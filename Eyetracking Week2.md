##Progress
This week, I found several modules to enable eye (and face) detection with Python, and I decided to use OpenCV. OpenCV is relatively easier for me to understand (than PyGaze).   

Installing OpenCV is a different story, however. I have to install *cmaker* and *dlib* seperately using Terminal. This process is way more complicated than I thought, since it involves not only Terminal (Linux) operation but also system and Python setup.   

The installation of OpenCV is not fully completed. At this point I can run a sample code with Python 2 but not Python 3. The cv2 package is not found when I am using Python 3, and I am still inspecting this problem and will continue be working on it until it gets fixed.

With this direction, I found a tutorial on YouTube and I am now following it to test all the functions provided by OpenCV. I am providing the link below.
