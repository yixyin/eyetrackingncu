##Week 1

The week has been struggling for me and the project. I ran into an unexpected problem of setting up AirSim on my computer. I am still figuring out this specific error on Mac that does not happen on Windows PCs, and this is expected to be done by the end of June. With this situation, the project timeline need to be edited to adapted the progress. But other than that, the Unreal Engine has been set up, and I can run a sample project.
